```
KafkaConsumer<String, GenericRecord> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(propsConsumer)
consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(topicConsumer))

ConsumerRecords<String, GenericRecord> records = consumer.poll(1000)

for(ConsumerRecords<String, GenericRecord> record : records) {
    GenericRecord avroRecordConsum = record.value()
    log.info("Current  record value: " + record.value().toString())
    String eventIdConsumer = avroRecordConsum.get("eventHeader.eventId").toString()
```
